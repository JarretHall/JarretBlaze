	<h1>The Mystical Sounds</h1>
	<p>The sounds that surround the forest are chirps of birds, flapping of wings, cricket sounds.They live alone quietly in the forest, but some tend to venture out into the city.The weather is humid, with some chances of rain storms, similar to a rainforest. Animals & laughter is what the people hear in their daily life.</p>
